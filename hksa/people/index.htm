              <p>Hi! My name is Jason Khoo and I am a Junior at Stanford majoring in Human Biology with a concentration in Technological Innovations in Underserved Communities. I was born in the States but was raised in Hong Kong for most of my life. Growing up in HK afforded me so many opportunities to interact with a wide variety of traditions and perspectives. This diverse background is best represented in my love for all kinds of food. I look forward to molding HKSA into an amazing platform for students to learn and engage with the beautiful blend of cultures that is Hong Kong.</p>
